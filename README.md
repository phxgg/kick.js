# kick.js

kick.js is a powerful and flexible JavaScript/TypeScript library for interacting with the Kick.com API. It is designed to simplify the process of building applications that leverage Kick.com's features, providing developers with an easy-to-use interface for accessing various functionalities.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently in an early development stage. The API is not stable yet and may change significantly in future releases. Use at your own risk.

## Features

This library is currently under active development. This is what I am aiming for right now:

- Comprehensive API Coverage: Access a wide range of Kick.com API endpoints with ease.
- TypeScript Support: Fully typed interfaces and types for better developer experience.
- Webhook Handling: Built-in support for managing and responding to Kick.com webhooks.
- Modular Design: Easily extend and customize the library to fit your needs.
- Active Maintenance: Regular updates to keep up with Kick.com's API changes.
